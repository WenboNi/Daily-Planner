# Employee Daily-Planner

## Description

This application was deployed to help busy employees manage and keep track of the daily tasks of their day-to-day schedule. The application
allows employees of any organization to manage their time effectively and plan out what they need to do in advance (i.e in the morning) so that they dont miss out on any critical tasks.

## Installation

Acess the website application through the URL: wenboni.github.io/Daily-Planner

## Usage

Upon accessing the website, users will enter the task they need to accomplish within the time block of the task/activity. For example, if you have a training session at 9am, enter training session beside the 9am timeblock and click save on the icon in the blue next to the text area in which you entered the task description. 

Time blocks that are in the past hours of the day will be shown in grey. Timeblocks that are in the future will display as green and the present timeblock will be displayed in red.

When the page is refreshed, all saved items will remain in the text area even though the time block's hour may have passed. Users can also go in and edit existing, past or future task descriptions in the text area. Users may enter notes for completed events to keep track of what they have done or they can further edit future scheduled items.
